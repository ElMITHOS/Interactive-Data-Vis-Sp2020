      <h2>The Murderous US Police...</h2>
    </div>
    <section class="step" data-step="1">
      <p>
        2020 was certainly a year where the rapid succession of unfortunate events had everybody’s tension levels higher
        than usual. For some, it was too much to handle. It caused some people to lose their mind. Many lost it 
        so badly that ended up contributing to the mountain of problems we were already facing, by acting on
        emotion, irrationally, solely based on hearsay, and unfounded claims that were turned into tabloid news
        by irresponsible reporters (to name one example: the “Toilet Paper Rush”).
        Now that  tensions have seemingly lowered, and we hopefully are able again to have reasonable conversations
        based on evidence, for the benefit of everyone, I have put together some data regarding maybe
        the most controversial topic in the United States in 2020: Murder by Police officers in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        By consulting several sources, including the Washington Post, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
        this project seeks to analyze how much is true regarding the claims that led directly and indirectly
        to one of the most violent times in the history of United States of America as revealed by the
        Time magazine “Gun violence and gun crime has, in particular, risen drastically, with over 19,000
        people killed in shootings and firearm-related incidents in 2020. That’s the highest death toll in
        over 20 years, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), an online site that collects
        gun violence data, and the Britannia Group’s non-partisan site procon.org.”
        Was all this death justifed? Are the thousand of nameless fatherless children at least to find solace
        in knowing that the killing of their parents was not senseless?
      </p>
      <p>It is beyond doubt that human history is filled with racial tension. Back in the early stages of civilization,
        allowing another group of people to enter your tribe could be a matter of life and death. "Is that other tribe
        trying befriend us or invade and conquer us?" As a result, people were extremely careful of those who spoke or
        looked differently. This led to multiple tribal and territorial wars. Empires rose and fell based on this
        determinant. As humanity progressed, we understood that the determinant was not the color of the skin nor the
        language. That there were white people who were bloodthirsty and other groups of white people were friendly,
        there were black people who were peaceful and those who were not, and that some native Americans
        were violent while others were actually trying to find ways to stop the violent ones.
        Then we learned that it wasn't even a matter of groups, but of individuals.
      </p>
      <p>The United States was one of the last countries in this side of the world to understand this lesson. Irish,
        African American, Japanese, Latin etc. were all at some point target of discrimination in the US. It was not
        until after 1960's when this lesson learned started to become the national norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the year 2015, The Washington Post started recording every fatal shooting by a police officers on-duty 
        in the United States. In that time there have been more than 5,000 such shootings recorded by The Post.
        The claim that started the violence was that African Americans are hunted down by police officers and shot
        for no reason. That the police are systematically racist and that the only solution to this crisis is the
        dismantling of the police.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statisticians Erika Harrell, Ph.D., and Elizabeth Davis from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, report that
        in the prior 12 months, as of 2018, among persons age 16 or older:
        <li>61.5 million residents had at least one contact with police.</li>
        <li>Twenty-four percent of residents experienced contact with police, up from 21% in 2015.</li>
        <li>Whites (26%) were more likely than blacks (21%), Hispanics (19%), or persons of other races (20%) to experience police contact.</li>
        <li>There was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of whites (12%) and blacks (11%) who experienced police-initiated contact</li>
