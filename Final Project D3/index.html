      <h2>The Murderous US Police...</h2>

        2020 was certainly a year where the rapid succession of unfortunate events had everybody’s tension levels higher
        than usual. For some, it was too much to handle. It caused some people to lose their mind. Many lost it 
        so badly that ended up contributing to the mountain of problems we were already facing, by acting on
        emotion, irrationally, solely based on hearsay, and unfounded claims that were turned into tabloid news
        by irresponsible reporters (to name one example: the “Toilet Paper Rush”).
        Now that  tensions have seemingly lowered, and we hopefully are able again to have reasonable conversations
        based on evidence, for the benefit of everyone, I have put together some data regarding maybe
        the most controversial topic in the United States in 2020: Murder by Police officers in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        By consulting several sources, including the Washington Post, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
        this project seeks to analyze how much is true regarding the claims that led directly and indirectly
        to one of the most violent times in the history of United States of America as revealed by the
        Time magazine “Gun violence and gun crime has, in particular, risen drastically, with over 19,000
        people killed in shootings and firearm-related incidents in 2020. That’s the highest death toll in
        over 20 years, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), an online site that collects
        gun violence data, and the Britannia Group’s non-partisan site procon.org.”
        Was all this death justifed? Are the thousand of nameless fatherless children at least to find solace
        in knowing that the killing of their parents was not senseless?
